  <i style="background-color: yellow">If you think the current editor form is missing a field that is commonly
    given as a reason for rejecting an article, please add the new field here. Be as descriptive as possible
    while keeping the feedback generic so that it can be used for other articles. Remember that as soon as you save, the feedback form
    will be updated for all editors.</i>
