  <p class="question">How long does it take for an article to be reviewed? </p>
  <p>It depends on the article. If there are very few mistakes it can take anywhere from a few hours to a couple of days. If the article needs to be corrected by the editor or needs bigger changes, it can take up to five days to be either returned or published.</p>
  <p class="question">How long does it take for an article to be published? </p>
  <p>Usually when an article has been approved, it'll be published right away. Sometimes, however, it will be delayed by a few days if there have been many recently published articles.</p>
  <p class="question">How long should my article be? </p>
  <p>The perfect article length is around 1000+ words. Slightly shorter articles are okay if they are filled with lots of images/gifs.</p>
  <p class="question">I don't want comments on my article. How do I turn them off?</p>
  <p>Once your article is published, there will be an option on the edit page of your article that says "Turn off commenting". You can also delete individual comments under your articles.</p>
  <p class="question">How often should I submit an article?</p>
  <p>Preferably, you should be uploading articles at least once every two weeks so that our site can stay active. You can opt-in to bi-weekly article
    assignments your <%= link_to "edit profile page", edit_user_path(current_user) %>. There is no limit to how many articles you can submit per month, and we would love for you to write as many articles as you have time for.</p>
  <p class="question">How do I include images? </p>

  <p class="question">What if I want to write something that doesn't fit a category? </p>
  <p>If you want to pitch an article idea that doesn't fit a category, it might not be right for The Teen Magazine, but you can reach out to any one of the editors through the Facebook group to ask about your idea.</p>
  <p class="question">What if I have a friend that wants to write for The Teen Magazine?</p>
  <p>That's great! Tell your friend to apply at <a href="http://www.theteenmagazine.com/apply">www.theteenmagazine.com/apply</a>. We will then review your friend's application and send her an email with her account if she's accepted.</p>
  <p class="question">How can I pitch an article idea? </p>
  <p>Only editors can pitch article topics to the Unclaimed Pitches page but if you have your own article idea that you want to write, you can pitch the topic to our editors. Please follow the guide explained in <a href="/choosing-a-topic">Pitching an Article</a>.</p>
  <p class="question">How can I become an editor?</p>
  <p>The application can be found on your writer dashboard once you've published at least one article. To have the best shot of being accepted, you should wait until after you've had at least three articles published. Please note that we want to keep our editor team small, so if you are not accepted the first time you apply,
    do not become discouraged. Stay active in the writer team and try again at a later date.</p>
  <p class="question">How can I change my password? </p>
  <p>You can change your password  <a target="_blank" href="/users/edit">here</a>.</p>
