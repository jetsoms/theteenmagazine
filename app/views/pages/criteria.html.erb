  <p class="question">How long does it take for an article to be reviewed? </p>
  <p>Editors have a deadline of 48 hours to review an article once they claim a review. You will be notified via email when this happens and your article's status on your home page will change to "In Review".</p>
  <p class="question">How long does it take for an article to be published? </p>
  <p>Usually when an article has been approved, it'll be published right away. Sometimes, however, it will be delayed by a few days if there have been many recently published articles.</p>
  <p class="question">I don't want comments on my article. How do I turn them off?</p>
  <p>Once your article is published, there will be an option on the edit page of your article that says "Turn off commenting". You can also delete individual comments under your articles.</p>
  <p class="question">How often should I submit an article?</p>
  <p>Preferably, you should be uploading articles at least once every two weeks so that our site can stay active, but there are no hard requirements around this.</p>

  <p class="question">What if I have a friend that wants to write for The Teen Magazine?</p>
  <p>That's great! Tell your friend to apply at <a href="http://www.theteenmagazine.com/apply">www.theteenmagazine.com/apply</a>. We will then review your friend's application and send her an email with her account if they're accepted.</p>
  <p class="question">How can I pitch an article idea? </p>
  <p>Only editors can pitch article topics to the Unclaimed Pitches page but if you have your own article idea that you want to write, you can pitch the topic to our editors. Please follow the guide explained in <a href="/choosing-a-topic">Pitching an Article</a>.</p>
  <p class="question">How can I become an editor?</p>
  <p>The application can be found on your writer dashboard once you've published at least one article. To have the best shot of being accepted, you should wait until after you've had at least three articles published. Please note that we want to keep our editor team small, so if you are not accepted the first time you apply,
    do not become discouraged. Stay active in the writer team and try again at a later date.</p>
  <p class="question">How can I change my password? </p>
  <p>You can change your password  <a target="_blank" href="/users/edit">here</a>.</p>
