  <h3><b>How to find images that are safe to use:</b></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Use reputable websites: Look for established websites that offer royalty-free or creative commons images, such as <b>Unsplash, Pixabay, Pexels, or Wikimedia Commons</b>. These websites typically provide images that are free to use for various purposes, including commercial use, without the need for attribution or payment.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use advanced search filters: When using search engines like Google, utilize advanced search filters to narrow down results to images that are labeled for reuse or modification. You can do this by selecting "Tools" > "Usage Rights" and choosing an appropriate option, such as "Labeled for reuse" or "Labeled for noncommercial reuse."
    </li>
    <li>
      Check licenses and terms of use: Read and understand the licenses and terms of use associated with the images you find. Some images may require attribution, have restrictions on usage, or may not be allowed for certain purposes. Make sure to comply with the stated terms of use to avoid copyright infringement.
    </li>
    <li>
      Consider using public domain images: Public domain images are not protected by copyright and can be used freely for any purpose. There are websites that offer collections of public domain images, such as Public Domain Pictures, Public Domain Archive, or the Library of Congress.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3><b>Which Images Are Not Safe to Use:</b></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Copyrighted images: Avoid using images that are protected by copyright unless you have obtained proper authorization or a license to use them. Copyrighted images are owned by the creator or owner and are subject to legal protection, which means that unauthorized use can result in copyright infringement.
    </li>
    <li>
      Images without proper attribution or permission: Some images may be labeled as "free to use" but require attribution or permission from the creator or owner. Always check the licensing terms and requirements for proper attribution or permission, and comply with them to avoid any legal issues.
    </li>
    <li>
      Watermarked or copyrighted images: Avoid using images that contain watermarks, logos, or other indications of copyright ownership, unless you have proper authorization or a license to use them. Using such images without permission can result in copyright infringement.
    </li>
    <li>
      Images from unknown or sketchy sources: Be cautious when using images from unknown or unreliable sources, as they may not have proper authorization or may not be legitimate royalty-free sources. Stick to reputable websites and verify the legitimacy and usage rights of the images before using them.
    </li>
    <li>
      Images with recognizable people or trademarks: Avoid using images that contain recognizable people or trademarks without proper authorization, as this may infringe on privacy rights or trademark laws. Be mindful of using images that depict identifiable individuals, brands, logos, or trademarks without proper permission.
    </li>
    <li>
      Embedded images without proper authorization: Embedding images from social media platforms may not always be considered safe in terms of copyright compliance, as the original uploader may not have obtained proper authorization or may have only granted permission for personal, non-commercial use. Always make sure that an embedded image from social media was created by the user and ask the creator for permission, where possible.
    </li>
  </ul>
