    </li>
    <li>
      Royalty-Free Images: You may use royalty-free images that are licensed for free use or under a Creative Commons (CC) license, provided that you comply with the terms of the license and properly attribute the images. It is your responsibility to verify the licensing terms of any image you use to ensure that it is free to use for your intended purpose.
    </li>
    <li>
      Prohibited Images: You must not use any images that are copyrighted, trademarked, or otherwise protected by intellectual property rights, without obtaining proper authorization from the owner. Please see Which Images Are Not Safe to Use.

    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3><b>How to find images that are safe to use:</b></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Use reputable websites: Look for established websites that offer royalty-free or creative commons images, such as <b>Unsplash, Pixabay, Pexels, or Wikimedia Commons</b>. These websites typically provide images that are free to use for various purposes, including commercial use, without the need for attribution or payment.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use advanced search filters: When using search engines like Google, utilize advanced search filters to narrow down results to images that are labeled for reuse or modification. You can do this by selecting "Tools" > "Usage Rights" and choosing an appropriate option, such as "Labeled for reuse" or "Labeled for noncommercial reuse."
    </li>
    <li>
      Check licenses and terms of use: Read and understand the licenses and terms of use associated with the images you find. Some images may require attribution, have restrictions on usage, or may not be allowed for certain purposes. Make sure to comply with the stated terms of use to avoid copyright infringement.
    </li>
    <li>
      Consider using public domain images: Public domain images are not protected by copyright and can be used freely for any purpose. There are websites that offer collections of public domain images, such as <b>Public Domain Pictures, Public Domain Archive, or the Library of Congress</b>.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3><b>Which Images Are Not Safe to Use:</b></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Copyrighted images: Avoid using images that are protected by copyright unless you have obtained proper authorization or a license to use them. Copyrighted images are owned by the creator or owner and are subject to legal protection, which means that unauthorized use can result in copyright infringement.
    </li>
    <li>
      Images without proper attribution or permission: Some images may be labeled as "free to use" but require attribution or permission from the creator or owner. Always check the licensing terms and requirements for proper attribution or permission, and comply with them to avoid any legal issues.
    </li>
    <li>
      Watermarked or copyrighted images: Avoid using images that contain watermarks, logos, or other indications of copyright ownership, unless you have proper authorization or a license to use them. Using such images without permission can result in copyright infringement.
    </li>
    <li>
      Images from unknown or sketchy sources: Be cautious when using images from unknown or unreliable sources, as they may not have proper authorization or may not be legitimate royalty-free sources. Stick to reputable websites and verify the legitimacy and usage rights of the images before using them.
    </li>
    <li>
      Images with recognizable people or trademarks: Avoid using images that contain recognizable people or trademarks without proper authorization, as this may infringe on privacy rights or trademark laws. Be mindful of using images that depict identifiable individuals, brands, logos, or trademarks without proper permission.
    </li>
    <li>
      Embedded images without proper authorization: Embedding images from social media platforms may not always be considered safe in terms of copyright compliance, as the original uploader may not have obtained proper authorization or may have only granted permission for personal, non-commercial use. Always make sure that an embedded image from social media was created by the user and ask the creator for permission, if possible.
    </li>
  </ul>

    <li>Purpose: This policy outlines the guidelines for the use of copyrighted material under the doctrine of fair use in entertainment articles published on our website.
    </li>
    <li>
      Definition of Fair Use: Fair use is a legal doctrine that allows for the limited use of copyrighted material without obtaining permission from the copyright owner. Fair use applies to certain purposes, such as criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, and research, and is subject to a case-by-case analysis based on various factors, including the nature of the copyrighted work, the purpose and character of the use, the amount and substantiality of the portion used, and the effect on the potential market for the copyrighted work.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fair Use in Entertainment Articles: Writers may use copyrighted material, such as images, screenshots, video clips, or other media, in their entertainment articles under the doctrine of fair use when such use is necessary for criticism, commentary, news reporting, or other transformative purposes related to the subject of the article.
    </li>
    <p>
      Guidelines for Fair Use in Entertainment Articles:
    </p>
    <li>

      Use original content whenever possible: Whenever possible, use original content created by the writer or content that is in the public domain or properly licensed for use.

    <li>
      Consider alternative options: Explore alternative options for obtaining proper permissions or licenses from the copyright owner when using copyrighted material that may not clearly fall under fair use.
