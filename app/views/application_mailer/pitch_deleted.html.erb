    <p>Hi <%= @user.first_name %>,</p>
    <p>This is an email notifying you that your pitch, <%= @pitch.title %>, was deleted by an admin. This means that it did not meet the criteria explained <a href="https://www.theteenmagazine.com/pitching-new-articles">here</a>. For your reference, the pitch title, description, and thumbnail image are displayed below.</p>
    <h3><%= @pitch.title %> (deleted)</h3>
    <p><%= @pitch.description %></p>
    <img class="image_max_400" src="http:<%= @pitch.thumbnail.variant(resize_to_fill: [540, 380]) %>" alt="<%= @pitch.title %> thumbnail image">
    <p>An admin reserves the right to delete pitches from Editor Pitches within 48 hours of it being created. Deleted pitches will not be counted toward your 10 required pitches every month. If you have any questions about this decision, please reach out to mia@theteenmagazine.com with clarifying questions.</p>
